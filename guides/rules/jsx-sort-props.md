### 📚 Why Enforce Prop Order?

Sorting JSX props alphabetically:

- Makes components easier to scan visually.
- Reduces unnecessary diffs in version control (e.g., git).
- Helps maintain a consistent coding style across teams.
- Aids in spotting duplicates or missing props faster.

### ✅ Correct Usage

```tsx
<MyButton color="primary" disabled label="Submit" />

<UserCard age={30} firstName="John" lastName="Doe" />
```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage

```tsx
<MyButton label="Submit" color="primary" disabled />
              ^^^^^^^^
// 'color' should come before 'label'

<UserCard lastName="Doe" age={30} firstName="John" />
            ^^^^^^^^^^
// 'age' should come before 'lastName'
```
